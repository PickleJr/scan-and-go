This app is still in the development phase.

Running this app or building this app on your own computer assumes you have NPM installed.

To install dependencies for the app, run `npm install` from the root of app.

This app is fully functional so long as you are able able to get your own server up in running (This is just a demo at this point in time. Not hosted on any website.)
This application utilizes the device camera and a server based routing system. Meaning (at this point in time) to utilize the app, you must view the
application on "localhost" - not just static files. To do that, either run `npm start` or `npm build` and use a customer server application to host the generated files.

## FUTURE TODOS:
* Provide user feedback in camera mode.
* Fix Camera when user alternates from portrait to landscape
